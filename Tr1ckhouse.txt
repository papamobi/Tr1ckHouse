!getmotd - Shows everyone the message of the day- discord link.
!myperm - check your permission level
!id - What you'll usually call before a lot of the other commands. You give it parts of people's names and it replies with a list of players that matched it. It ignores colors.
Ex.: !id min cool would list all players with those two tokens in their name. "Mino", "COOLLER" and "^5I A^2M MI^6NO" would all be possible candidates.
You can always do /players in the console, but this can save you some time if you're only looking for a player or two, especially since it can be done from chat too.

!players - same as /players in console
