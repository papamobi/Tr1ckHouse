// Servers have the ability to run multiple gametypes, known as "factories." You should not add gameplay related
// cvars in the server config: they may get overwritten by the factory. For creating your own sets of gameplay rules,
// create a file ending in ".factories" inside baseq3/scripts, and refer to "Creating custom gametypes" in the
// server_readme.txt file.

// Be aware that factories can override any cvar, including ones specified in this config file.
